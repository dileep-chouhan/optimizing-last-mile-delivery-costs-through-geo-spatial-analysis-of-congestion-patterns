# Optimizing Last-Mile Delivery Costs through Geo-Spatial Analysis of Congestion Patterns

## Overview

This project analyzes real-time and historical traffic congestion data to optimize last-mile delivery routes and minimize delivery costs.  The analysis identifies congestion patterns and recommends specific route adjustments to reduce fuel consumption and transit time. The goal is to achieve a 10% reduction in last-mile delivery costs through data-driven route optimization.  The project leverages geo-spatial analysis techniques to pinpoint areas of significant congestion and proposes alternative routes based on this analysis.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* [Add other libraries used here, e.g., geopandas, requests, etc.]

## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install the required Python libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Script:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   Ensure that you have the necessary data files (specified in the data directory or within the script) in the correct location.  The script may require configuration based on your specific data sources and API keys (if applicable).  Please refer to the inline comments within `main.py` for detailed instructions.


## Example Output

The script will output the following:

* **Console Output:**  Printed analysis summarizing key findings, including identified congestion hotspots and suggested route adjustments. This will include quantitative metrics demonstrating potential cost savings.
* **Plot Files (if applicable):**  Visualizations such as maps highlighting congestion areas and optimized routes (e.g., `congestion_map.png`, `optimized_route.png`).  The specific output files will depend on the data and the analysis performed.  These will be saved in the `output` directory.
